<body class="homework">
<p>Create a web site about a place that you've lived or visited. The website should include at least 10 separate linked pages. You will be graded on your basic design, organization of information, content, navigation and use of HTML5 and CSS (both text and positioning). Include as a part of your project a separate linked page documenting what you have done in each category.</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Your website should include at least 10 separate linked pages (that&rsquo;s 10 separate .html files, including the homepage), with an index page located at serenity.ist.rit.edu/~[abc1234]/240/project1/index.html.</p>
<p><strong>All materials for this individual site must be written by you in your own words.</strong> You may not use anything from anywhere else at all. All graphics and visual images for this site must have been created by you. You may not use anything from anywhere else at all. In other words, this is a website that you make ... all by yourself. Did I remember to mention that <em><strong>you must make everything for this project?</strong></em></p>
<p>The <em>only</em> exception is photographs. You may use images from other sites or sources, but you <em>must</em> cite your sources within your site (visible to the site visitor) and you <em>must</em> manipulate the images in some way (resize, recolor, resample, etc).</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Divide the content up into appropriate "chunks" of information, and design the site in a way that enhances the presentation of the content. This means you need to think about how to break it up, how to label it, how to navigate through it, keeping in mind who your audience is. I will be evaluating the quality of your content, as well as your information organization and navigation.</p>
<p>Use CSS for text formatting and layout. <strong>Do not</strong> use inline or document-based styles. Use a linked style sheet that controls formatting for some aspect(s) of all of the pages in the assignment.</p>
<p>You can assume I'll be using a current generation browser(s) to view your pages, but don't assume that it will (or won&rsquo;t) be IE, or that it will be a specific hardware platform.</p>
<p>Focus for this project should be on design and content, including photos. What is the best way to display the pictures? Do the pictures really advertise or convince you that this place is some special place you have been?</p>
<h2>Due Date</h2>
<p>This project is due Week 7, Friday: <br /><strong>Friday, October 13, 2016 at 11:59pm.</strong></p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<h3>Some graphical and interaction design notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>It should be obvious to a site visitor that all pages are part of the same site. Use repetition. Include the same components on all pages: site title, site logo, formatting (page title, content, navigation).</li>
<li>The global navigation should be accessible on all pages. I.e. a site visitor should be able to jump to any top-level page from any other page within the site.</li>
<li>Prevent your site visitor from getting lost. At a minimum, there should be a <strong>page title and site title on every page</strong>. Breadcrumbs can be very helpful, especially if your site is more than two levels deep.</li>
<li>Make your site easy to navigate &ndash; both between pages and within pages. If you have pages with long content, consider a 'back to top' link at the bottom of them. Consider a navigation system with fixed positioning.</li>
<li>Page titles (&lt;title&gt; tags) should reflect the actual content of the page, not just be something generic, like "John's site about NYC".</li>
<li>Your site must display well across all major, modern browsers. If you use a technique that is not supported by a particular browser, make sure it fails gracefully.</li>
<li>DO NOT use WordArt (for anything, ever).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some content notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You should probably have a map. Your site is about a physical location, after all, and a picture is worth a thousand words&hellip; Don't just use any map that you find of your place though! It should relate to your content. If you find a map that mentions a bunch of tourist spots, but none of them are mentioned in your site, that's not the map for you. Don't be afraid to use more than one map, e.g. one that shows places you mention within your site, another that shows where your location is within the surrounding area, etc.</li>
<li>Unless you took the photos yourself, there must be an <strong>explicit citation for each photo</strong> that accompanies each photo.</li>
<li>You are being graded on your content. Do not expect two sentences to sufficiently describe your location. Write the content as if you would actually want to read it yourself. Try to convince site visitors that this is a place they would really want to visit.</li>
<li>You must cite all of your references on your 'about' page.</li>
<li>There should be <strong>NO typos</strong>. None. Spelling should be perfect. Grammar should be excellent. If English spelling or grammar isn't your best subject, get someone (or two or three someones) to proofread your site. Spell check your site.</li>
<li>The 'about' page does not count toward the requirement of 10 content pages. Nor may a contact page count toward the 10 pages.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some code design notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You must use <strong>server-side includes for ALL repeated content</strong> (e.g. header, footer, global nav, etc).</li>
<li>Make sure your code is easy to read. Use plenty of whitespace, indentation, and comments. Your code structure should make sense (one CSS file linked to all pages; similar CSS selectors grouped together; no HTML tables for non-tabular data).</li>
<li>Your CSS file(s) should be commented as well!</li>
<li>You must use HTML5 and all pages must <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">validate</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You must use <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_new_elements.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML5 semantic/structural elements</a>&nbsp;where appropriate</li>
<li>You may not use&nbsp;<em>any</em> code (including HTML and CSS) that you did not write yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>You will be graded on your:</p>
<ol>
<li>basic design</li>
<li>organization of information</li>
<li>content</li>
<li>navigation</li>
<li>and use of HTML5 &amp; CSS (both text and positioning)</li>
</ol>
<p>Include as a part of your project a separate linked "About" page (in addition to the 10 required content pages) documenting what you have done in each and every grading category above, which is linked from your homepage. <strong>You will lose 10% for not having an "About" page.&nbsp;</strong>The &ldquo;About&rdquo; page should also have any needed citations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>To receive an A your midterm must also be well-written, have excellent graphics that flow with the text, and be appropriately organized. <strong>It must be way above</strong><strong> average.</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will lose 10% per day that your project is late. Even one minute late constitutes a late submission.</li>
<li>Your project is not considered submitted until you have uploaded a zip file of all files (both HTML and CSS) and posted a link to your site on Banjo.</li>
<li>You must include an "About" page that details what you have done in each of the categories listed in the rubric. You will lose up to 10% if this page is missing or incomplete.</li>
